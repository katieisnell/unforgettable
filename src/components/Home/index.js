            <h2>Project title: ‚Äú#unforgettable: What are the social factors associated with memorable photographs?‚Äù</h2>
              <p>
                In this project I have explored the use of tags, and emotion-recognition to distinguish key memorable images from social media feeds. 
                I have determined what makes an unforgettable image different from other images, and developed an end-to-end web application solution which shows these tags in a user-friendly way.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project has a focus on recognising key objects in images and labelling them, and then quantifying their unforgettableness by analysing the amount of searches on Google with regards to each label.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take some time to explore the application! Create an account, and then try to upload some of your memories. You might be surprised what is unforgettable for you <span role='img' aria-label='thinking'>ü§î</span>...
